    <h1>Energy Consumption across various states in Australia</h1>
    <h2>By: Jasmine Shrestha and Ahsan Khan</h2>
    <p> 
        A report by the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XLQbHahrRHOEb4G0aEZuFRORNB_86CK9/edit?pli=1#gid=731989108"><b>Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources from Australia Energy Statistics</b></a> has found that global energy consumption has been increasing rapidly. 
        The aim of this webpage is to <br> visualize this change over the course of multiple years (i.e., 2008 to 2020) and also compare the consumption rates for different fuel types across Australia, as well as for each state.
